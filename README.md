## Configuration
- Use the [webhook](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/webhooks/we_1O3GFhEK2GzEipqWVMsp01sI) setup.
- The webhook used above is linked to the constant STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET value in the env. This value was generated via stripe cmd and is not identical to the one on the GUI but works.
- Use STRIPE_SECRET_KEY found in .env.example.
